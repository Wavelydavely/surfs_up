Overview of the analysis: 

After an idyllic vacation in Hawaii, my alter ego has had an epiphany that we could pursue our newly-found passion of surfing while running a surf gear and ice cream shop. We conveniently have a connection with a fellow surfer, W. Avy, who also happens to be an investor, and is intrigued by our novel concept. He has some two concerns related to weather trends, and whether or not businesses supported by tourism maintain profitability throughout the year. We have shown that our preferred location of Oahu has less severe rainfall than other regions, now we need to demonstrate that temperatures are suitable for surfing and ice cream throughout the year.


Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
	-June's high temperature averages at 85 and low at 64
	-Dec's high averages at 83 low at 56
	-Full-year pleasant temps

Summary: 

So far, our idea seems plausible. We have found a location with unusually consistent weather, even for Hawaii. We would like to consider rain and wind speed, as well as storm data that wouldn't have as much as an affect on long-term data. Overall, we are pleased with our findings.
